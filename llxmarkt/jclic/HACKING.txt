                ** json (http://json.org)

* lib
  External libraries needed to compile JClic:
  - jmf-api     Java Media Framework API empty implementation, to be used only at compile time.
                (http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/)
  - qtjava-api  QuickTime for Java empty implementation, to be used only at compile time.            
                (http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/qtjava/)  
  - servlet-api Needed to compile the J2EE version of JClic reports. Empty implementation, to be 
                used only at compile time. (http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/reference/api)

* deploy
  Contains the "applicaton.xml" file, used in the J2EE web application of 
  JClic reports
  
* dist
  This is the directory where the JAR files obtained as result of the build 
  process are stored. It contains also some scripts, icons and JNLP (Java 
  Network Launching Protocol) files.
  
* instal
  This directory contains a script that generates the Windows installer of 
  JClic using the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System 
  (http://nsis.sourceforge.net). It contains also an Ant script that launches 
  NSIS and creates a ZIP with all the files needed to run JClic in any 
  Java-enabled system.

* i18n
  Contains utilities used to translate JClic into different languages.
  JClic uses Launchpad (https://translations.launchpad.net/jclic) as a translation platform.
  
* keystore
  This folder contains a key store with a test certificate, that can be used
  to sign the JAR files for test purposes. Please use your own certificate 
  if you plan to distribute your own versions of the program.
  
* xml
  XML Schema (XSD) and Document Type Definitions (DTD) corresponding to the 
  documents used by JClic to store skins and projects.

Edit instructions:

JClic was made using NetBeans, currently version 3.7.
You can download this IDE from:

https://netbeans.org/downloads/

Build the extensions by launching "ant" from the following subdirectories:
extensions/dbconn
extensions/img/image4j
extensions/json
extensions/xml
extensions/soundspi

Copy the resulting jar files into the "lib" directory:
extensions/dbconn/build/dbconn.jar
extensions/img/image4j/dist/image4j.jar
extensions/json/build/json.jar
extensions/xml/build/jdom.jar
extensions/soundspi/build/soundspi.jar

Launch NetBeans, create a new project and mount the following 17 
filesystems from the directory containing the JClic source code:

File-based filesystems:
lib/jdom.jar
lib/dbconn.jar
lib/soundspi.jar
lib/json.jar
lib/image4j.jar

Directory-based filesystems:
lib/jmf-api
src/activities
src/author
src/core
src/extra
src/interface
src/jclicApplet
src/jclicPlayer
src/player
src/shapers
src/utilities
src/report/reportServer
src/report/reportServlets
src/report/webApp

After mounting the last filesystem, a new one will be automatically created:
src/report/webApp/WEB-INF/classes

The classes are distributed into different directories.

The JClic classes are organized into the following Java packages:
