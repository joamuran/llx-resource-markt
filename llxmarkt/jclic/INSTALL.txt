JClic: Authoring and playing system for educational activities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document is for people who want to hack and compile JClic
from the source code.

If you just want to download and install JClic, please go to:
http://clic.xtec.cat/en/jclic/download.htm


Compilation instructions:
-------------------------
The current version of JClic compiles with version 1.5 or later of the 
Java Development Toolkit (JDK)

Compilation is done with Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/), version 1.6.5 
or later.

If your Java version is 1.6 or later, it's advisable to obtain the "rt.jar"
file of Java 1.5 and place it into the directory "lib/bootstrap/1.5". This
file is not provided with JClic because it's a not redistributable binary, 
but can be downloaded from the Oracle Java Archive:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/archive-139210.html

If you don't have the file "lib/bootstrap/1.5/rt.jar", the "rt.jar" file of your
current JVM will be used as a bootstrap class path. This will generate a lot
of warnings during compilation, but usually no errors. Just ignore it.

To compile JClic, just open a console, go to the root directory of the JClic source
code (where the build.xml file is located) and invoke "ant".

The JAR files must be signed to be used in applets. A test certificate key
is provided in "keystore/testcert.keystore".
Please don't use code signed with this key in production releases: always 
sign it using your own certificate. For more information, see the document
"keystore/readme.txt"

At the end of the build process, the resulting JAR files will appear into 
the "dist/jclic" directory.

To start the programs, copy all the contents of the "dist/jclic" directory to an 
appropiate place and enter the following commands:

- To launch JClic:
  java -jar jclic.jar

- To launch JClic author:
  java -jar jclicauthor.jar

- To launch JClic reports:
  java -jar jclicreports.jar
  
- To setup the J2EE version of JClic reports, see:
  http://clic.xtec.cat/es/jclic/reports/

The JClic modules can also be launched as a Java webstart applications. For more
information about this option, see:
